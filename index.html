                        <h3>Battle of the Titans</h3>
                        <p>The Battle of the Titans, also known as the Titanomachy, was a monumental ten-year series of battles fought in Thessaly between the older generation of gods, the Titans, and the Olympians led by Zeus. The conflict arose after Zeus freed his siblings from the stomach of Cronus and rallied them to overthrow the Titans, who had ruled the cosmos under Cronus's leadership. The Olympians, supported by allies such as the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, fought relentlessly, with Zeus wielding his powerful thunderbolts. The battle concluded with the defeat of the Titans, who were imprisoned in Tartarus, while Zeus and the Olympians assumed control of the heavens, the sea, and the underworld, marking the beginning of their reign over the cosmos.</p>

                        <h3>Birth of Zeus</h3>
                        <p>The birth of Zeus is one of the most crucial events in Greek mythology. Zeus was the youngest child of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Cronus, fearing a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him, swallowed each of them at birth. When Zeus was born, Rhea, desperate to save him, devised a plan. She hid baby Zeus in a cave on the island of Crete, entrusting him to nymphs and the goat Amalthea. To deceive Cronus, Rhea presented him with a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, which Cronus swallowed without suspecting a trick. Zeus grew up in secret, and once he reached adulthood, he confronted Cronus, forced him to regurgitate his siblings, and ultimately fulfilled the prophecy by overthrowing his father.</p>

                        <h3>Punishment of Prometheus</h3>
                        <p>Prometheus, one of the Titans, played a critical role in the development of humanity by gifting them with fire, an act of defiance against Zeus’s command. Prometheus saw the potential in humanity and wanted to help them advance by giving them fire, which symbolized knowledge, warmth, and the ability to create tools. Zeus, however, feared that this gift would make humans too powerful. Furious at Prometheus for his disobedience, Zeus condemned him to an eternal punishment. Prometheus was bound to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains, where every day, an eagle, the symbol of Zeus, would eat his liver. Being immortal, Prometheus’s liver would regenerate each night, ensuring endless torment. His suffering continued until the hero Hercules, as part of his Twelve Labors, came to his rescue and freed him from Zeus’s punishment.</p>
